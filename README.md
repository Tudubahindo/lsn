My git repo for the Laboratorio di Simulazione Numerica class of Prof. D. E. Galli, academic year 2023/24, unimi

The course material is divided in 12 lectures, and for each lecture the students are required to complete an exercise. For each lecture I created a specific directory containing the lecture material, the assignment and my solution.

The code has been tested on tolab machines, so it should run w/out issues there.

Special thanks to my colleagues Alessio Serraino and Stefano Pilosio on the invaluable feedback they provided on some technical issues.
